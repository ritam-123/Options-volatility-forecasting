# Options-volatility-forecasting
This project deals with the pricing and forecasting of options, with a focus on AAPL stock. We compute implied volatility from historical market data taking use of the Black-Scholes model.
Then we compare these results with predictions from a machine learning modelâ€”a neural network. The neural network is trained to forecast implied volatility based on key option features such as strike price, time to maturity, and option type (call/put).

Key features:

-> Automated computation of implied volatility using historical options data

-> preprocessing and filtering the raw data to ensure high quality inputs

-> Neural network-based prediction of implied volatility

-> Visualization of predicted vs actual implied volatility for evaluation of model.
